A Fabric mod that adds a few farming utilities to make your life just a little bit easier.

## Client Features

**Mature Crop Effects** - It's time to bring a little bit of sparkle to your farms.

> Mature crops will be given a (configurable) particle effect to help them stand out against crops that still need to
> catch up a little bit.

**Early Harvest Prevention** - Stop killing your crops before it's time.

> Immature crops will dodge your wild harvesting, so you can ravage through your farm without worry. This is temporarily
> deactivated while sneaking.

## Server Features

**Trample Prevention** - Stop sneaking around your farms in fear.

> Cropland will no longer be trampled by any entity.
